# Fitness-Watch-HCI-Project-Study
This repository contains the project study I conducted as part of my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course at Vellore Institute of Technology. The focus of this study was on a Fitness Watch, where I explored various aspects related to user experience and interface design.

# Project Components
- Target Audience: Identified and analyzed the intended users of the Fitness Watch, understanding their needs and preferences to tailor the interface accordingly.
- Limitations and Possible Solutions: Investigated potential constraints and challenges faced by users while interacting with the Fitness Watch. Proposed effective solutions to enhance user experience.
- Task Analysis: Conducted a detailed task analysis to map out user interactions with the Fitness Watch. The analysis covered essential tasks such as logging activities on the device and checking goal statuses.
- Storyboardings and Input-Output Devices: Developed visual storyboards to illustrate user scenarios and interactions with the Fitness Watch. Explored input and output devices to ensure a seamless user experience.
- Heuristics Evaluations: Conducted evaluations based on established HCI heuristics to identify usability issues and opportunities for interface optimization.
- Cognitive Walkthrough: Simulated user interactions to evaluate the Fitness Watch's usability and user-friendliness, making iterative improvements based on cognitive feedback.
- Project Report: A comprehensive project report summarizing the entire study, including methodologies, findings, and recommendations.
  

The insights gained from this project study are invaluable for designing and developing user-centric fitness wearable devices. I am sharing this work to contribute to the HCI community and inspire future projects that focus on creating visually appealing, user-friendly, and efficient interfaces.
